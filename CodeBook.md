## From the original data source:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

    	The data was merged from the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
	Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set

    	The data set was appropriately labeled with descriptive variable names. 

	Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement was extracted.
    
	Finally, an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.


All this procedure was done using R and applying the script that appears in the run_analysis.R
